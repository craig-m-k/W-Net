# W-Net for unsupervised segmentation

https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08506

Based on these repos:

* https://github.com/lwchen6309/unsupervised-image-segmentation-by-WNet-with-NormalizedCut
* https://github.com/zwenaing/unsupervised-image-segmentation 

*Note that the latter has errors in both the data pipeline and in the implementation
of W-Net, which have been corrected here.*
